# Personal HomePage

This is one of my *weekend fun* projects.  I wanted the chance to play with my new **PHP** knowledge learned from a **[Frontend Masters course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/php/)** taught by the wonderful **Maximiliano Firtman**.  Also I'll be using **vanilla CSS** for a change and the new, to me, `@layer`s.

## The Idea
This will be a very personal homepage for myself. It won't be responsive at all probably...

*Although just typing that out had me getting bad chills and thinking I might just want to check it out on my mobile... So maybe I'll make it responsive later.*

Anyway, this will be a *throw the kitchen sink at it project*.  I'm going to add in some of the beginner projects I haven't tackled in my main languages, like **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Python**.  This is my chance to check âœ… some things off my list, including:
- a working clock
- a time zone checker *(I do have this as a CLI, but not on the web yet)*
- calls to a weather API *(again I have this as a CLI only so far)*

Then I'm just going to toss in anything else I think of.
